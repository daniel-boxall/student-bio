            So a little about me, firstly i am a school drop out i left at 14 thinking i was grown enough to make it my own and was homeless by the time i was 15.
            as you can emagine i was a bit of a mess, i was in and out of prison for a few years and then i decided to sort my self out and start an education. So in febuary of 2022
            i started the <a href="https://freecodecamp.org/daniel-boxall" alt="link to my freecodecamp.org profile">freecodecamp.org</a> course in front-end development passed the first two courses and got stuck, so rather than plowing on and getting frustrated i decided
            to take CS50x which i have now completed. Mean while i enrolled in BCs (Software) comunication and IT which started in October of 2022 so i am currently working on that 
            to the tune of 120credits (full-time) along side this bootcamp. 
            </p>
            <p>
            My goal is to become a front-end engineer with the end goal of self employment/freelancing and to be able to work from anywhere in the world.
            Once established as a free lance engineer then i wish to start a web development agency with a few other like minded people.
